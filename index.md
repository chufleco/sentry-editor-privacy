# Privacy Policy for Sentry Editor

**Last updated:** February 4, 2026

## Overview

Sentry Editor is a video viewer and editor for Tesla Sentry Mode and Dashcam footage. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Data We Collect

### Video Files
- Your Tesla video files are processed **locally on your device only**
- We do **not** upload, store, or transmit your videos to any server
- All video editing and exporting happens on your device

### Analytics & Crash Reporting
- We use **Firebase Crashlytics** to collect crash reports
- This helps us fix bugs and improve the app
- Crash data includes device type, Android version, and error details
- No personal information or video content is included

### Advertising
- We use **Google AdMob** to display ads in the free version (banner, interstitial, and rewarded ads)
- AdMob may collect device identifiers for personalized ads
- You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings

### Ad Usage Counter
- To enforce the free premium export trial limit, we store a usage counter in **Firebase Firestore**
- This record contains an anonymous device identifier (Android ID) and an integer count
- No personal information is associated with this identifier
- You can request deletion of this record by contacting us

### Location Data
- The app displays GPS coordinates embedded in your Tesla videos
- This data comes from your video files, not from your device's GPS
- GPS coordinates are sent to **Google Maps** and **Google's Geocoding API** to display maps and convert coordinates to city/street names
- We do not operate our own servers — location data is only shared with Google services for map and geocoding features
- Video files themselves are never uploaded

### Purchases
- **Google Play Billing** processes all in-app purchases
- Purchase tokens are exchanged with Google Play to verify Pro status
